Bring data in real time using Google Realtime Analytics (GRA).

It's a complete backend system ready to use if you have a Google Analytics Account and a Firebase user. 

We use Firebase for database and client side javascript asynchronous calls to bring data from GRA.

The system is build using Flask 0.12 and Python.
